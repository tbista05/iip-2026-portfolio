For 2026 IIP Vietnam

## 1. WaterStory
https://github.com/tbista05/water-story-home

WaterStory is a high-performance environmental data platform visualizing Great Lakes ecosystem health. Using Next.js, TypeScript, and Mapbox GL JS, I developed an interactive geospatial interface that renders real-time data from NOAA and GLOS APIs, including satellite-derived chlorophyll maps and live buoy metrics. By optimizing data fetching with TanStack Query and managing the workspace with pnpm, I ensured a scalable architecture capable of delivering complex scientific insights—such as phosphorus runoff and algal bloom trends—to a general audience through a seamless, Vercel-deployed frontend.

Tech Stack:
- React
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
  
- TanStack Query (React Query), Context API
- Mapbox GL JS, GeoJSON, NOAA/GLOS API Integration

- Node.js
- Turborepo
- pnpm

## 2. TigerTunity
https://github.com/tbista05/tigertunity-portfolio

Tiger­tunity Portfolio is a full-stack web application designed to centralize and present club-related information for a student community. It features a dedicated frontend interface for browsing and interacting with content, backed by a server-side backend that manages data storage and retrieval. The system includes database schema setup and persistent storage, illustrating a complete user-oriented web app workflow.

A key feature of the system is an automated listserv ingestion pipeline that parses raw campus emails using AI and converts them into structured event posts, allowing opportunities to be surfaced without manual entry. The application demonstrates a complete modern web workflow, from frontend UI and backend APIs to database design and cloud deployment.

I collaborated in a team of 4 students to architect, implement, and deploy both frontend and backend components. My primary contributions included implementing the listserv email parsing, frontend UI layout, login authentication, and feed page debugging.

Tech Stack:
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- CSS Modules

- Python
- Flask
- RESTful APIs

- PostgreSQL (NeonDB)
- Zapier (email ingestion & workflow automation)
